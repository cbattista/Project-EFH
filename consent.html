<p>
The purpose of this study is to investigate the source of individual differences in
executive functioning. Executive functions are higher-order cognitive abilities involved
in the regulation of attention and behavior. Individuals differ in how effectively they can
regulate their attention and behavior. This study investigates the role of training in
bringing about these differences.
</p>
<p>
In this study, adult individuals will receive six hours of training in the regulation
of attention and the retention of information for short periods of time. Participants will
complete 6 one-hour computer-based training sessions, two per week for 3 weeks.
Participants will complete the training on-line through their own personal computer, and
will receive 6 study hour credits. Of interest is whether these executive functioning skills
improve with a short amount of intensive practice and generalize to other tasks that are
cognitively demanding.
